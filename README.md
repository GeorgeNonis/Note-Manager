### Target of Note Manager :triangular_flag_on_post:

<p>
      <h3>Fullstack project with Node.js & Express.js & React.js
      This project by itself was a huge boost for my experience as I learned how to write backend code as well,
      and what http request's are being handled and also how as Frontend dev's we receive response's from the Backend
      No Css library's have been used or Javascript lib and the reason is I wanted this project to be a challenge
      for me as I had to see how to think outside of the box to implement it's feature's</h3>
